a simple fastapi app with all functionalities of post, get , update and delete.
install fastapi and uvicorn first, and then run "uvicorn fastap:app --reload"
this would give you a url and add "/docs" in that url and test the api model.
this api is built with a fake db and can be modified and scaled for a large app 
with database conncetion . 

thnak you guys
